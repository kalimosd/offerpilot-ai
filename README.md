# OfferPilot AI

**AI job assistant that turns weak applications into interview-ready ones.**

Your resume reads like a job description copy-paste?<br>
Your cover letter could belong to literally anyone?<br>
Your strongest projects are buried on page two?<br>
You did the work — but the paper doesn't show it?

Stop underselling yourself. Let AI sharpen what's already true.

Feed in your resume and a job description,<br>
get back a stronger resume, a tailored rewrite, a JD-fit analysis, or a cover letter —<br>
grounded in your real experience, not hallucinated fluff.

## Why This Project

Many international students and early-career candidates do strong work but present it weakly. Their resumes are too generic, their cover letters feel interchangeable, and their most relevant experience gets buried.

OfferPilot focuses on outcomes: clearer positioning, stronger materials, and better odds of getting interviews.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Resume optimization** | Tightens wording, removes filler, strengthens bullet points — without inventing facts |
| **Job-targeted rewriting** | Rewrites and reorders content around a specific job description |
| **JD fit analysis** | Identifies match signals, gaps, and rewrite priorities |
| **Cover letter generation** | Produces concise, tailored letters grounded in real experience |
| **Profile datastore** | Pulls the most relevant experience from a structured YAML data source |
| **Job discovery** | Scans career portals and search engines to find relevant openings automatically |
| **PDF export** | Renders Markdown drafts to styled PDFs with photo embedding support |

## Quick Start

1. Prepare `resume.md` (or `resume.pdf`)
2. Prepare `job.md` for the target role
3. Open `skill-pack/README.md`
4. Run the workflow through Cursor, Claude Code, or a Codex-style agent
5. Review the generated Markdown output, then export when ready


## Example Output

**Before**

```text
- Responsible for Android development and worked with different teams.
- Helped fix bugs and improve app performance.
```

**After**

```text
- Improved Android system stability and performance by diagnosing rendering,
  memory, and ANR issues with Perfetto and Systrace, then driving fixes
  across platform teams.
- Owned delivery for recent-tasks features, coordinating engineering
  stakeholders to ship on schedule and close cross-team issues faster.
```

These outputs are meant to be directly usable with minimal editing.

## Tech Stack

- Python · LLM-powered rewriting and analysis
- Modular skill-pack architecture
- YAML-based profile datastore
- Playwright-based PDF export and portal scanning

## Advanced Usage

Extract text from PDF or DOCX:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/extract_text.py "resume.pdf" --output "resume.txt"
```

Export a reviewed draft to PDF:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/render_pdf.py "resume.md" "resume.pdf" --document-type resume --style classic
```

Export with a photo embedded in the header:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/render_pdf.py "resume.md" "resume.pdf" --style standard_cn --photo "photo.jpg"
```

Scan career portals for matching job listings:

```bash
# Full scan (CN APIs + Greenhouse + web search)
python3 skill-pack/scripts/scan_portals.py

# Chinese company APIs only (Meituan, Kuaishou, Didi)
python3 skill-pack/scripts/scan_portals.py --cn-only

# Greenhouse API only (international companies)
python3 skill-pack/scripts/scan_portals.py --greenhouse-only

# Web search only (DuckDuckGo, covers 20+ companies)
python3 skill-pack/scripts/scan_portals.py --search-only

# Preview without writing files
python3 skill-pack/scripts/scan_portals.py --dry-run
```

Matched jobs are saved to `jds/` with full JD content and application links. Scan history is tracked in `data/scan-history.tsv` for deduplication.

## Roadmap

- RAG-based job search and resume knowledge system
- Interview simulation and feedback
- Better datastore retrieval and ranking
- Agent-driven application workflows
- Resume versioning and targeting automation
