# Workflow

Use this workflow for all OfferPilot tasks.

## 1. Classify the Task

Choose one of:

- general resume optimization
- job-targeted resume rewrite
- jd-fit diagnosis
- cover letter generation

## 2. Collect Inputs

Minimum inputs:

- original resume source
- target language: `same`, `zh`, or `en`

Additional inputs when needed:

- job description for targeted resumes
- job description for jd-fit diagnosis
- job description for cover letters
- user-provided preferred romanization of the candidate name

Input handling rules:

- if the source is `.txt` or `.md`, read it directly when possible
- if the source is `.pdf` or `.docx` and the agent cannot read it reliably, run `python3 skill-pack/scripts/extract_text.py "path/to/file"` first
- use the extracted text as the working input after extraction succeeds

## 3. Normalize the Source of Truth

- Prefer the original resume over any previously generated output
- If older generated drafts exist, treat them as reference only
- If the original file is private, avoid adding it to version control
- If the source content is sparse, improve clarity but do not invent facts

## 4. Generate the Draft

For jd-fit diagnosis:

- extract the core requirements from the JD
- identify direct evidence from the resume
- separate matched, partial, and missing signals
- explain the biggest fit gaps in practical language
- prioritize concrete rewrite suggestions

For resume optimization:

- preserve the candidate's actual experience
- tighten phrasing
- remove filler
- emphasize measurable impact only when the source supports it

For targeted resumes:

- align with the job description
- surface matching keywords naturally
- prioritize the most relevant experience

For cover letters:

- connect the resume to the job description
- stay specific
- keep the tone concise and credible

## 5. Review the Draft

Check:

- names
- dates
- role titles
- company names
- section ordering
- factual consistency
- language consistency
- whether the fit conclusion is supported by evidence from both the JD and the resume
- whether rewrite suggestions are specific enough to act on

If the draft is in English and the source name is Chinese:

- verify `Given Name + Family Name`
- if the user already supplied the preferred spelling, use that exact spelling

Example:

- `中文名` -> `<Given Name> <Family Name>`

## 6. Finalize the Deliverable

Preferred order:

1. review Markdown-like content first
2. revise content if needed
3. produce final export-ready formatting or PDF
