# Scripts

These scripts are optional helpers for the OfferPilot skill pack.

They support the workflow, but they are not the source of truth. The source of truth still lives in the documents under `skill-pack/`.

## Included Scripts

### `extract_text.py`

Use when the source resume or JD is a `.pdf` or `.docx` file and the agent cannot read it reliably.

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/extract_text.py "resume.pdf" --output "resume.txt"
```

### `render_pdf.py`

Use when the workflow already produced a reviewed Markdown-like deliverable and you want a local PDF export.

**Prerequisites**: PDF 导出**只走 Playwright（Chromium）**，不再降级到 ReportLab。若未安装浏览器，脚本会尝试自动执行 `python -m playwright install chromium`；若仍失败会直接报错。

```bash
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
```

若 IDE 注入了空的 `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH`，脚本会尽量改用本机默认缓存目录（macOS 为 `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright`）。

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/render_pdf.py "resume.md" "resume.pdf" --document-type resume --style classic
```

### `validate_inputs.py`

Use for a quick sanity check before running a workflow, especially when there is a risk that the chosen file is already a generated artifact instead of the original source.

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/validate_inputs.py "resume.md" "job.md"
```

### `validate_outputs.py`

Use for output checks after generation, such as output subdirectory placement, filename plausibility, unresolved placeholders, section ordering, Markdown/PDF pairing, or optional English name formatting checks.

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/validate_outputs.py "targeted_resume.md" --english-name "GivenName FamilyName"
```

### `validate_profile_store.py`

Use before datastore-based resume assembly, evaluation, outreach, or interview preparation. It checks required YAML fields, `birth_year`, bullet tags, `impact` values, skill levels, and whether tags align with `data/skill_aliases.zh-en.json`.

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/validate_profile_store.py "profile_store.yaml"
```

### `validate_aliases.py`

Use after editing `skill-pack/data/skill_aliases.zh-en.json`. It checks JSON shape, lowercase canonical keys, empty aliases, and duplicate alias terms.

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/validate_aliases.py
```

## Schemas

- `skill-pack/schemas/profile_store.schema.json`: machine-readable structure for `profile_store.yaml`
- `skill-pack/schemas/skill_aliases.schema.json`: machine-readable structure for the alias JSON mapping

### `run_pipeline.py`

Use when you want an end-to-end recommendation cycle in one command:

1. scan portals (optional)
2. read recent added jobs from history
3. score and rank jobs
4. output a Top-N recommendation report

Example:

```bash
python3 skill-pack/scripts/run_pipeline.py --days 7 --top-n 10 --cn-focus
```

## Usage Rules

- Prefer direct file reading when the agent can handle the source natively
- Use these scripts only when they add reliability or convenience
- Review Markdown-like output before exporting to PDF
- Validate `profile_store.yaml` before workflows that depend on bullet selection or structured evaluation
- Keep new helper logic in `skill-pack/scripts/` rather than introducing a parallel product layer
