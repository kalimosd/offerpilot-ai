# Outputs

## Output Categories

OfferPilot supports three main output types:

- resume diagnosis
- optimized resume
- job-targeted resume
- jd-fit diagnosis
- cover letter

## Resume Diagnosis Expectations

- identifies strengths that are already supported by the source
- identifies gaps relative to either general job-readiness or a target job
- calls out risks without inventing problems
- suggests the highest-value rewrite priorities before generation

## JD-Fit Diagnosis Expectations

- explains how well the resume matches the target JD
- separates matched, partial, and missing signals
- prioritizes practical rewrite actions over abstract commentary
- uses a score only as supporting context, not as the sole conclusion
- avoids `ATS score` framing for China-first outputs unless explicitly requested

## Language Options

- `same`: keep the source language unless the source is mixed and the user asked for cleanup
- `zh`: produce professional Simplified Chinese
- `en`: produce polished English for job applications

## Resume Output Expectations

- clear sectioning
- concise bullet points
- stronger action-oriented phrasing
- no fabricated facts
- no inflated metrics
- compact, interview-ready tone
- preserves real source contact details in the final deliverable unless the user explicitly requested anonymization
- does not leave placeholder fields such as `<name>`, `<phone number>`, or `<email>` in application-ready outputs
- does not add guessed or fabricated contact details that are missing from the source

## PDF Style Options

The `render_pdf.py` script supports multiple styles via `--style`:

- `classic` — default, left-aligned, clean layout
- `ats` — optimized for ATS parsing, slightly smaller text
- `compact` — tighter margins and spacing for dense content
- `standard_cn` — centered name and contact info, section headings with solid underline, sub-headings with light dashed underline, dates right-aligned

## PDF Formatting Rules

- Project links (e.g. GitHub URLs) should be placed on a separate line below the project title in small text, not inline with the title
- Dates in headings are rendered right-aligned; all date columns start at the same horizontal position
- Section headings and their content are kept together across page breaks when possible

## Recommended File Naming

Use scheme `B` by default for locally saved resume deliverables:

- if only a target role is known: `姓名_岗位_v1`
- if both company and role are known: `姓名_公司_岗位_v1`
- keep the version suffix even for the first saved draft
- use `_` as the separator
- avoid spaces in filenames
- keep Markdown and PDF filenames aligned except for the file extension

Examples:

- `候选人A_安卓开发工程师_v1.md`
- `候选人A_小米_安卓开发工程师_v1.md`
- `候选人A_小米_安卓开发工程师_v2.pdf`

If the user explicitly requests anonymized sample files, replace `姓名` with an obvious example name rather than a real person.

## Targeted Resume Expectations

- emphasizes experience relevant to the target role
- incorporates job-description language naturally
- reorders emphasis without changing the underlying facts

## Cover Letter Expectations

- reflects the job description
- stays grounded in the candidate's real background
- avoids generic filler
- keeps the tone professional and direct

## English Name Check

When the source resume is Chinese and the output is English:

- verify the English name order
- default to `Given Name + Family Name`
- keep the user-provided spelling if one exists

Example:

- `中文名` -> `<Given Name> <Family Name>`
